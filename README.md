## Running the program
To run the program, run the main programm in the ```OurProject```-folder. To do this, you give the program two parameters:
- Whether you run the program hierarchically (1) or in the control condition (0).
- The subject number/name. This is needed to generate the results-file in the end.

The program can thus be run as follows:

```python3 main.py 1 myname```
This runs the program in the hierarchy condition and saves the results as ```results_participant_myname.txt```.
